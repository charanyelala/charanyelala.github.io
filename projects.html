                                    <p><b>NOTE:</b> This article you're about to read is just an idea which i felt to share just as a common man.</P>


                                        <p>Democracy is considered the best form of government. I think that's valid but is there any way we can upgarde it to even better or best of that matter?
                                        <br>I would say "yes".</p> 
                                        
                                        <p>As far as we concerned it is the best form of government but it has various drawbacks. To discuss that first we need to understand the pillars of democracy
                                        <br>Democracy has four main pillars: Legislation, Judiciary, execution, media</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Everything was fine initially. But, it begins to change over time as one pillar tried to control another pillar through various means including corruption. If somehow a government manages to capture the remaining pillar it would turn out to a game over for democracy. (which by the way happening/happened as we speak)
                                        In the present scenario, every government is able to get a media under their control, some executioners, and even possibly judiciary. With the majority of the citizens being easy to be manipulated just by media it makes the worse scenario in any democracy for its true definition.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Below are the existing flaws in the democracy design (source: https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/01/16/is-democracy-problem-pub-7813),</p>
                                        
                                        <p><b>Short-termism:</b> Due to their electoral cycles, democracies struggle to focus on long-term problems and usually remain mired in short-term policy approaches.</p>
                                        <p><b>Pain aversion:</b> To the limited extent they do manage to look to the long term, democratic politicians are averse to imposing near-term pain for long-term gain because of their need to keep voters happy for the next election.</p>
                                        <p><b>Elite capture:</b> By opening up decision-making power to competition among politicians who are constantly in need of money for elections, democratic systems are prone to become captured by the wealthy.</p>
                                        <p><b>Division and conflict:</b> Competitive elections foment or exacerbate destructive societal divisions, generating conflict and undercutting a strong sense of national unity and purpose.</p>
                                        <p><b>Voter ignorance:</b> Relying on ordinary citizens to choose leaders and make judgments among them based on policy performance condemns democracies to leadership and policy choices that reflect chronic voter ignorance and irrationality.</P>
                                        
                                        
                                        <p>If we look at the above-mentioned flaws as an individual problem we may never get a perfect solution.<br>
                                        
                                        Instead, we may need one solution.<br>
                                        
                                        The direct democracy method was able to solve some part of the corruption problems in democracy. and we take it to next level<br>
                                        
                                        <B>POSITIVE DEMOCRACY</b></P>
                                        
                                        <p>The form of government that can be formed and supported by citizens who are righteous, has morality, integrity, and honesty citizens especially excluding people of criminal records from the ability to vote.</P>
                                        
                                        <p>This government will only be formed by citizens who meet the mentioned criteria and not like suppressing the votes of citizens as mentioned by some people for testing IQ to vote. This doesn't suppress votes.</P>
                                        All citizens need to do is be good and don't harm any human. Remember one bad vote is equal to a wastage of 2 good votes. 
                                        and to participate in an election you just don't need to be good and intelligent but wise. If a leader is good he may become socialist and can destroy the economy and if he is only intelligent he just ends up controlling people for power. So in this form of government precisely need wise people who are a combination of both good character and intelligence.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>This step can solve all the problems existing in the present democracy design if implemented properly.
                                        
                                        But a big question raises here, how or who is going to identify who is qualified and who is not. This involves screening of all citizen's criminal records and will be assigned to a character identification number which will be based on their deeds in the past. With certain points below they may lose their ability to vote.
                                        
                                        The education I proposed in one of my projects has a good chance of making the leaders we need for this government from the beginning.
                                        
                                        And trying to invent more screening procedures and perfect them for now.
                                        
                                        And we also need to come up with ideas, even more, to make this concept efficient. If this is properly implemented imagine all the good it does to the world and people around.
                                        this also makes voting a privilege and not just a right and makes everyone vote.
                                        
                                        <br><br>The only people that don't agree to this... you know the type!</p> 
                                        
                                        <p>If you have any questions or identified flaws in this form of government, text me with your perspective. Would definitely like to hear it.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>This is just a thought of mine... it may or may not be implemented but I think it's worth sharing an idea that has a chance to change the world for good.</p>

                                    <p>This system's main focus is to bridge the gap between all education instutions from pre-school to universities, home schooling and self-education which each student phases out through.</p>
                                    <p>Every kid is brought into this world with the same heart and brain however with little genetic variations, culture, and religious differences. Which later they tend to deviate as they grow, some become good and others bad, some become intelligent, some mediocre, and some imbecilic.</p>
                                    <p> so, we aim to create a simulation environment in all educational institutions from pre-school to universities for bringing down those deviations  to as little as possible and bringing out the best in each student</p>
                                    <p>There is so much to this education. However, we narrowed it down to some key features which will not just be on paper but with maximum efficiency. With never seen before interventions and methodologies.</p>
